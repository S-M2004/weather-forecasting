Weather prediction using ML models with live + future 8-hour data

# 🌦️ Weather Forecasting Website

This project is a full-stack weather forecasting platform that predicts live and future weather conditions using Machine Learning models and historical weather data.

It shows real-time temperature, humidity, and precipitation values, and forecasts the next 8 hours using multiple models. Users can also view comparison graphs across five different time series forecasting models.
